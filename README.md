Sure, here's an example README.md file you could use to explain how to run your Tauri Tic-Tac-Toe game app on GitHub:

# Tauri Tic-Tac-Toe Game App

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game app built with Tauri, a framework for building native desktop applications using web technologies.

## Installation

To run this app on your machine, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed. You can download them from their respective websites or using a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for Mac users) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (for Windows users).

Once you have Node.js and Rust installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/The-flasSK/teec-tac-toe.git
cd tauri-tic-tac-toe
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server and launch the app, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will open a window with the Tic-Tac-Toe game app. You can make changes to the code and the app will automatically update.

## Building

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the built app that you can distribute or install on your own machine.
